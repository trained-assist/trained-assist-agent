# Free/cheap LLM credentials — how to call them

Context: issue #584 (multi-step PR auto-triage pipeline — analyze failed CI,
draft a fix, verify, clarify issues, draft PRs for simple bugs). Every sub-agent
step in that pipeline should default to a cheap/free model via OpenRouter
instead of Claude, and fall back to Claude only when the cheap model fails or
the task needs deeper reasoning.

## Credential

- Env var: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — already declared in `src/secrets.js` (`OPTIONAL`
  list) and loaded the same way as every other integration key. No new secret
  plumbing needed; if a profile hasn't set it, `getOpenRouterKey()`-style
  lookups return `null` and callers should skip/fallback (see
  `src/hh-scoring.js:271`).
- Set per-profile like any other secret: `/settoken` flow or the credentials
  form (`src/mcp-skills/tools/23-credentials-form.js`), or directly in the
  profile's secrets store.

## Call pattern (already used in this repo)

OpenRouter is called as a plain OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint:
`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`, header
`Authorization: Bearer ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`.

Existing call sites to copy from:
- `src/hh-scoring.js` — model selection + fallback pattern
  (`FALLBACK_MODEL = 'google/gemini-2.5-flash'`)
- `src/mcp-skills/tools/41-applylink.js` — PDF/resume extraction via
  OpenRouter (`gemini-2.5-flash` native file parsing + `gpt-4o-mini` text
  fallback, run concurrently, pick the more complete result)
- `src/hh-bullshit-guard.js`, `src/session-summary.js`, `src/project-summary.js`,
  `src/mcp-skills/tools/96-label.js` — cheap-model classification/summary calls

## Recommended models for pipeline steps

| Step | Task | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Analyze failed PR/CI logs | `deepseek/deepseek-chat` (a.k.a. "DeepSeek V3") | strong at reading logs/diffs, cheap |
| 2 | Draft a fix from the analysis | `deepseek/deepseek-chat` or escalate to Claude if the diff touches >1 file / architecture | code-editing capable, cheap |
| 3 | Clarify an issue (gather info from past sessions) | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` | fast, cheap, good at summarizing/collating |
| 4 | Prepare a PR for simple bugs | same as step 2 | |
| 5 | Verify a fix (adversarial check) | run 3x with `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (cheapest) as independent voters, majority wins | matches the "3 attempts" pattern already used elsewhere (see `verify` skill / adversarial-verify pattern in Workflow tool) |

`google/gemini-2.0-flash-001` is retired (404) — do not use it; `2.5-flash` /
`2.5-flash-lite` are the live replacements (confirmed working on CID/Cyrillic
PDF OCR, see `agent-notes.md`).

## Budget/fallback rule

Every pipeline step must:
1. Try the assigned OpenRouter model first.
2. On empty/malformed response or 2 consecutive failures, fall back to Claude
   for that single step (not the whole pipeline) — same "3 attempts then
   escalate to human" cap requested in issue #584.
3. Never silently swallow a step failure — log which model handled the step
   in the PR/issue comment the pipeline posts, so cost and reliability are
   auditable per step.
