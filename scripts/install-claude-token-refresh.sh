# Idempotently install the Claude Code OAuth refresh broker as a user cron job.
#
# WHY CRON: this box's agent user is non-interactive (no user-DBus session), so
# `systemctl --user` is unavailable; every other scheduled ops job here lives in
# the user crontab (ops/cron/install.sh). The broker rides the same mechanism so
# a box reprovision re-creates it from deploy instead of silently dropping the
# guard that keeps the operator logged in. See docs/claude-oauth-refresh.md.
#
# (systemd units under scripts/systemd/ remain in the repo as an alternative for
# hosts that DO have an enabled user manager / linger.)
#
# Safe to run repeatedly: rewrites only the block between the markers below,
# leaving all other crontab entries untouched.
