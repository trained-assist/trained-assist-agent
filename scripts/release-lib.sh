# Release-directory mechanics for issue #1391 — sourced by the deploy scripts
# (scripts/deploy.sh, scripts/deploy-ru-edge.sh) and by tests.
#
# Prod is not a git working tree any more: a release is an immutable snapshot of
# a commit, built outside the session worktree, and the running version is chosen
# by atomically repointing a symlink. A session doing checkout/commit can no
# longer change what is served.
